## Research Interests

- Ecohydrological Remote Sensing
- Carbon-Water Cycle
- Ecosystem Carbon and Water Flux
- Deep Learning
- [My best research (Dec 2023)](https://TopGreenHand.github.io/file/CV-YangAo.pdf)üîó

My research focuses on **ecohydrological remote sensing** and **ecosystem carbon sinks**, mainly including coupling of carbon and water in **karst ecosystems**, threshold identification of carbon sinks, and stability of ecosystem carbon sinks.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
